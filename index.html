<p>My life, where each week I've been alive is a little box. When meaningful things happen (for both better and worse) I make a note of it so I can remember how much of life is influenced by these factors. If you'd like to create your own version of this, it's basically a <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown/weeks/blob/main/_data/life-in-weeks.yml">data file</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown/weeks/blob/main/_layouts/life-in-weeks.html">template</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown/weeks/blob/main/index.html">homepage</a> mashed together on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p>

<p>This is a specialized page from my main site <a href="https://brennan.day">brennan.day</a>, focused specifically on the life in weeks visualization.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks">Buster Benson's Life in Weeks</a> and <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">Tim Urban's "Your Life in Weeks"</a>.</p>
